//! ADR-117 — PyO3 bindings for the WiFi-DensePose Rust core.
//!
//! This crate is the compiled half of the `wifi-densepose` v2.x PyPI
//! wheel. The Python-facing facade lives in `python/wifi_densepose/`
//! and re-exports symbols from this module under their stable names.
//!
//! ## Phase status (per ADR-117 §6)
//!
//! - **P1 (scaffold) — this commit**: module loads, version constant
//!   exposed, smoke test passes via maturin develop.
//! - **P2**: bind `CsiFrame`, `Keypoint`, `PoseEstimate` (next).
//! - **P3**: bind 4-stage vitals + signal DSP.
//! - **P4**: pure-Python `wifi_densepose.client` (WS/MQTT) — no Rust
//!   surface needed; lives outside this crate.
//! - **P5**: cibuildwheel + PyPI publish.
